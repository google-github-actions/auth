# Troubleshooting

## Permission denied

1.  Enable [GitHub Actions debug logging][debug-logs] and re-run the workflow to
    see exactly which step is failing. Ensure you are using the latest version
    of the GitHub Action.

    > **⚠️ WARNING!** Enabling debug logging increases the chances of a secret
    > being accidentally logged. While GitHub Actions will scrub secrets,
    > please take extra caution when sharing these debug logs in publicly
    > accessible places like GitHub issues.
    >
    > If you do not feel comfortable attaching the debug logs to a GitHub issue,
    > please create the issue and then email the debug logs to
    > google-github-actions@google.com, including the GitHub issue number in the
    > subject line and email body.

1.  Ensure you have waited at least 5 minutes between making changes to the
    Workload Identity Pool, Workload Identity Provider, or IAM policies. Changes
    to these resources are eventually consistent. Usually they happen
    immediately, but sometimes they can take up to 5 minutes to propagate.

1.  Ensure `actions/checkout@v4` is **before** the `auth` action in your
    workflow.

    ```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: 'actions/checkout@v4'
      - uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v3'
    ```

1.  Ensure the value for `workload_identity_provider` is the full _Provider_
    name, **not** the _Pool_ name:

    ```diff
    - projects/NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL
    + projects/NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL/providers/PROVIDER
    ```

1.  Ensure the `workload_identity_provider` uses the Google Cloud Project
    **number**. Workload Identity Federation does not accept Google Cloud
    Project IDs.

    ```diff
    - projects/my-project/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider
    + projects/1234567890/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider
    ```

1.  Ensure that you have the correct `permissions:` for the job in your
    workflow, per the [usage](../README.md#usage) docs:

    ```yaml
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'
    ```

1.  Ensure you have created an **Attribute Mapping** for any **Attribute
    Conditions** or **Service Account Impersonation** principals. You cannot
    create an Attribute Condition unless you map that value from the incoming
    GitHub OIDC token. You cannot grant permissions on an attribute unless you
    map that value from the incoming GitHub OIDC token.

    > **ℹ️ TIP!** Use the [GitHub Actions OIDC Debugger][oidc-debugger] to print
    > the list of token claims and compare them to your Attribute Mappings and
    > Attribute Conditions.

1.  Ensure you have the correct character casing and capitalization. GitHub does
    not distinguish between "foobar" and "FooBar", but Google Cloud does. Ensure
    any **Attribute Conditions** use the correct capitalization. The
    capitalization must match what is in the GitHub Actions OIDC token.

1.  Check the specific error message that is returned.

    -   If the error message includes "Failed to generate Google Cloud federated
        token", it means admission into the Workload Identity Pool failed. Check
        your [**Attribute Conditions**][attribute-conditions].

    -   If the error message includes "Failed to generate OAuth 2.0 Access
        Token", it means Service Account Impersonation failed. Check your
        [**Service Account Impersonation**][sa-impersonation] settings and
        ensure the principalSet is correct.

1.  Enable `Admin Read`, `Data Read`, and `Data Write` [Audit Logging][cal] for
    Identity and Access Management (IAM) in your Google Cloud project.

    > **⚠️ WARNING!** This will increase log volume which may increase costs.
    > You can disable this audit logging after you have debugged the issue.

    Try to authenticate again, and then explore the logs for your Workload
    Identity Provider and Workload Identity Pool. Sometimes these error messages
    are helpful in identifying the root cause.

1.  If failures are coming from a different GitHub Action step, please file an
    issue against that repository. The `auth` action exports Google Application
    Default Credentials (ADC). Ask the action author to ensure they are
    processing ADC correctly and using the latest versions of the Google client
    libraries.

    **We do not have control over GitHub Actions outside of the
    `google-github-actions` GitHub organization.**


## Subject exceeds the 127 byte limit

If you get an error like:

```text
The size of mapped attribute exceeds the 127 bytes limit.
```

it means that the GitHub OIDC token had a claim that exceeded the maximum
allowed value of 127 bytes. In general, 1 byte = 1 character. This most common
reason this occurs is due to long repo names or long branch names.

**This is a limit imposed by Google Cloud IAM.** We have no control over
this value. It is documented [here][wif-byte-limit]. Please [file feedback
with the Google Cloud IAM team][iam-feedback]. The only mitigation is to use
shorter repo names or shorter branch names.


## Token lifetime cannot exceed 1 hour

If you get an error like:

```text
The access token lifetime cannot exceed 3600 seconds.
```

it means that there is likely clock skew between where you are running the
`auth` GitHub Action and Google's servers. You can either install and configure
ntp pointed at time.google.com, or adjust the `access_token_lifetime` value to
something less than `3600s` to allow for clock skew (`3300s` would allow for 5
minutes of clock skew).


## Dirty git or bundled credentials

By default, the `auth` action exports credentials to the current workspace so
that the credentials are automatically available to future steps and
Docker-based actions. The credentials file is automatically removed when the job
finishes.

This means, after the `auth` action runs, the workspace is dirty and contains a
credentials file. This means creating a pull request, compiling a binary, or
building a Docker container, will include said credential file. There are a few
ways to fix this issue:

-   Add and commit the following lines to your `.gitignore`:

    ```text
    # Ignore generated credentials from google-github-actions/auth
    gha-creds-*.json
    ```

    **This requires the `auth` action be v0.6.0 or later.**

-   Re-order your steps. In most cases, you can re-order your steps such
    that `auth` comes _after_ the "compilation" step:

    ```text
    1. Checkout
    2. Compile (e.g. "docker build", "go build", "git add")
    3. Auth
    4. Push
    ```

    This ensures that no authentication data is present during artifact
    creation.

-   In situations where `auth` must occur before compilation, you can use
    the output to exclude the credential:

    ```text
    1. Checkout
    2. Auth
    3. Inject "${{ steps.auth.outputs.credentials_file_path }}" into ignore file (e.g. .gitignore, .dockerignore)
    4. Compile (e.g. "docker build", "go build", "git add")
    5. Push
    ```

## Issuer in ID Token does not match the expected ones

If you get an error like:

```text
The issuer in ID Token https://github.<company>.net/_services/token does not match the expected ones: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com/
```

it means that the OIDC token's issuer and the Attribute Mapping do not match.
There are a few common reasons why this happens:

1.  You made a typographical error. If you are using the public version of
    GitHub (https://github.com), the value for the `oidc.issuerUri` should be
    `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`.

1.  You are using a GitHub Enterprise _Cloud_ installation and your GitHub
    administrator has configured a [unique token
    URL](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#switching-to-a-unique-token-url).
    Use that URL for `oidc.issuerUri` instead of the public value. You must
    contact your GitHub administrator for assistance - our team does not have
    visibility into how your GitHub Enterprise Cloud instance is configured.

1.  You are using a GitHub Enterprise _Server_ installation. In this case, you
    must contact your GitHub administrator to get the URL for OIDC token
    verification. This is usually `https://github.company.com/_services/token`,
    but it can be customized by the installation. Furthermore, your GitHub
    administrator may have disabled this functionality. You must contact your
    GitHub administrator for assistance  - our team does not have visibility
    into how your GitHub Enterprise Server instance is configured.


<a name="aggressive-replacement"></a>

## Aggressive *** replacement in logs

When you use a [GitHub Actions secret][github-secrets] inside a workflow, _each_
line of the secret is masked in log output. This is controlled by GitHub, not
the `auth` action. We cannot change this behavior.

This can be problematic if your secret is a multi-line JSON string, since it
means curly braces (`{}`) and brackets (`[]`) will likely be replaced as `***`
in the GitHub Actions log output. To avoid this, remove all unnecessary
whitespace from the JSON and save the secret as a single-line JSON string. You
can convert a multi-line JSON document to a single-line manually or by using a
tool like `jq`:

```sh
cat credentials.json | jq -r tostring
```

<a name="cannot-refresh"></a>

## Cannot refresh credentials to retrieve an ID token

If you get an error like:

```text
google.auth.exceptions.RefreshError: ('Unable to acquire impersonated credentials', '{"error": {"code": 400, "message": "Request contains an invalid argument.", "status": "INVALID_ARGUMENT"}}')
```

when trying to refresh credentials in Python code to get an ID token, this is
usually because the credentials are missing required scopes. The Google Auth
library requires scopes to be set when refreshing credentials for impersonation.

To fix this issue, add the required scopes before refreshing:

```python
from google.auth import default
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request

credentials, project = default()

# Add scopes before refreshing
credentials = credentials.with_scopes(
    ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"]
)
credentials.refresh(request=Request())

# Now you can access the ID token
print(credentials.id_token)
```

Alternatively, you can use the `token_format` parameter of this action to
generate an ID token directly:

```yaml
- uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v3'
  with:
    workload_identity_provider: ${{ secrets.WIF_PROVIDER }}
    service_account: ${{ secrets.WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}
    token_format: 'id_token'
    id_token_audience: 'https://example.com'
```

This will export the ID token as an environment variable that you can use in
your Python code.

## Organizational Policy Constraints

> **ℹ️ NOTE!** Your Google Cloud organization administrator controls these
> policies. You must work with your internal IT department to resolve OrgPolicy
> violations and constraints.

### Workload Identity Providers

Your organization may restrict which external identity providers are permitted
on your Google Cloud account. To enable GitHub Actions as a Workload Identity
Pool and Provider, add the `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com` to the
allowed `iam.workloadIdentityPoolProviders` Org Policy constraint.

```shell
gcloud resource-manager org-policies allow "constraints/iam.workloadIdentityPoolProviders" \
  https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

### Service Account Key Export

Your organization may restrict exporting Service Account Keys. To enable Service
Account Key export, set the `iam.disableServiceAccountCreation` to false.

```shell
gcloud resource-manager org-policies disable-enforce "constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountCreation"
```
